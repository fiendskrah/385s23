Key fundamentals include spatial sampling, descriptive statistics for areal data, inferential statistics, use of maps in data analysis.\n\n## Approach\n\n> The course takes an explicitly computational thinking approach to its pedagogy. Students are introduced to computational concepts and tools that are increasingly important to research that engages with geospatial data. By adopting these tools, students acquire a deeper engagement with, and mastery of, the substantive concepts.\n\n## Scope\n\n> In the scope of a 15-week semester course we can only introduce a handful of the key concepts and methods relevant to the field of spatial data analysis. As such, the course is not intended as an exhaustive treatment. Instead, the goal is that students will acquire an understanding of the more common and useful methods and practices, and use the course as an entry point for further engagement with the field.\n\n\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n![](images/prerequisites.png)\n\n\n\n## Schedule, Reading, and Content\n\nAll required readings are available through the links listed\nbelow. Assigned readings should be completed before the date listed in\nthe schedule (see below). Readings are a critical part of the\ndiscussions we will hold in class, and therefore coming into class\nprepared means having completed the readings and thought about the\ncontent. It will be difficult to do well in this course without having\ncompleted the readings.\n\n\n## Readings\n\n| Abbrevation | Source                                                                                      |\n|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| GDS         | Rey, S.J., D.

[specification\ngrading](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2016/01/19/new-ways-grade-more-effectively-essay)\nin evaluating student work and in determining your final course grade.\nYour course grade will be based on the quality and quantity of the work\nthat you submit that is evaluated to be of an acceptable level of\nquality. The acceptable level of quality demonstrates competency in the\nconcepts and methods covered in the course.\n\n## Base Grade\n\n  Level   Hurdles\n  ------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  A       Pass at least 8 of 10 quizzes, earn \\\"Demonstrates Competency\\\" on 4 of 4 exercises,\n          **and** submit an project that earns \\\"Demonstrates Competency\\\"\n  B       Pass at least 7 of 10 quizzes, earn \\\"Demonstrates Competency\\\" on 3 of 4 exercises\n  C       Pass at least 6 of 10 quizzes, earn \\\"Demonstrates Competency\\\" on 2 of 4 exercises\n  D       Pass at least 5 of 10 quizzes, earn \\\"Demonstrates Competency\\\" on 1 of 4 exercises\n  F       Fail to clear D-level hurdles\n  \n## Final Grade\n\n\n-   If you earn at least 85% on the final exam, you will obtain a + for\n    your grade. So an A base grade becomes a final A+ course grade, a B\n    becomes a B+, and so on.\n-   If you score between 70-85% on the final exam, your base grade\n    becomes your course grade.\n-   If you score between 50% and 69% on the final exam, you will obtain\n    a - for your grade. So an A becomes and A-, a B becomes a B-, and so\n    on.\n-   If you score less than 50% on the final exam, your course grade will\n    drop one level: An A base grade becomes a final B course grade.\n\n\n## Quizzes\n\nQuizzes are graded on a pass/fail basis. Starting in week two, there\nwill be a quiz due before each Tuesday session that pertains to the\nbackground reading that is required before our work in class.\n\n## Exercises\n\nFour exercises will be introduced in class and are due in two weeks.\n\nEach exercise is graded using a **CRN** rubric that classifies work with\nmarks of **C** (\\\"Demonstrates Competence\\\"), **R** (\\\"Needs\nRevision\\\"), or **N** (\\\"Not assessable\\\"):\n\n\n## Exercises\n\nOf each exercise the following questions will be asked: Does the work\ndemonstrate that the student understands the concepts? Does the work\ndemonstrate competence and meet the expectations outlined in the\nexercise?\n\nIf the answer is \\\"yes\\\" to both of the questions, a student passes the\nhurdle for that exercise.\n\n## Exercises\n\nIf the initial submission does not clear the hurdle, then a second\nquestion is asked: Is there evidence of partial understanding of the\nconcepts? If the answer to this question is \\\"Yes\\\" the student can\nexchange one token to attempt a revision of their work. If the answer is\n\\\"No\\\", the student does not clear the hurdle for this exercise and will\nnot have the opportunity to revise their work.\n\n\n\n## Project\n\nThe project is a required hurdle to earn a level A grade. In order to\nclear this hurdle, the project must obtain a \\\"Demonstrates Competence\\\"\nevaluation. There will be opportunities for feedback along the way, but\nthe final submission will be evaluated. There will be no opportunity for\nrevising this final submission.\n\n\n## Project\n\nStudents need to commit to the project by specifying their team (maximum\nof 4 members on a team) by **2-09**. Once the commitment is made, the team\ncomposition is final. Any student who does not submit a team definition\nby this date will not be able to pursue the project.\n\nDetails on the project rubric will be given out on **3-02**.\n\n## Final Exam\n\nA closed book, closed note, timed final exam will be given on TBD. The\nexam will be based on a blend of previous quiz questions and additional\nquestions that pertain to material covered in class.\n\n## Tokens\n\nEach student is provided with three tokens at the beginning of the\nsemester.\n\n## Using Tokens\n\n1.  One token can be used for a one-day extension for an exercise.\n\n2.  One token can be used to revise an exercise that was submitted\n    on-time but evaluated as \\\"Needing Revision\\\".\n\n3.  Two tokens can be used to request a make-up date for the final exam.\n\n## Earning Tokens\n\n1.  Handing in an exercise at least 24 hours before its due date.\n\n2.  Submitting all four exercises on time (or early).\n\n3.  Attempting all 10 quizzes.\n\n## Remaining Tokens\n\nEach token that remains unused after **4-27** will be counted as a passed\nquiz. *Tokens cannot be exchanged with other students*.\n\n\n## Aministration\n\n\n\n\n\n## Accomodations\nIf you are a student with a disability and are in need of\naccommodations for this class, please contact Student Ability\nSuccess Center at (619) 594-6473 as soon as possible.  Please know\naccommodations are not retroactive, and I cannot provide\naccommodations based upon disability until I have received an\naccommodation letter from Student Ability Success Center.\n\n## Privacy and Intellectual Property\nStudent Privacy and Intellectual Property: The Family Educational\nRights and Privacy Act (FERPA) mandates the protection of student\ninformation, including contact information, grades, and graded\nassignments. I will use [Canvas / Blackboard] to communicate with you,\nand I will not post grades or leave graded assignments in public\nplaces. Students will be notified at the time of an assignment if\ncopies of student work will be retained beyond the end of the semester\nor used as examples for future students or the wider public. Students\nmaintain intellectual property rights to work products they create as\npart of this course unless they are formally notified otherwise.\n\n\n## Academic Integrity\n\nThe SDSU student academic integrity policy lists violations in detail.\nThese violations fall into eight broad areas that include but are not\nlimited to: cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, facilitating academic\nmisconduct, unauthorized collaboration, interference or sabotage,\nnon-compliance with research regulations and retaliation. For more\ninformation about the SDSU student academic integrity policy, please see\nthe following: <http://www.sa.sdsu.edu/srr/index.html>.\n\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nAs course instructor, I am dedicated to providing a harassment-free\nlearning experience for all students, regardless of gender, sexual\norientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,\nor choice of operating system. All course participants are expected to\nshow respect and courtesy to other students throughout the semester. As\na learning community we do not tolerate harassment of participants in\nany form.\n\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\n-   All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience\n    including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and\n    imagery are not appropriate in this course.\n\n-   Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other students. Behave\n    professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or\n    exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for this course.\n\n-   Students violating these rules may be asked to leave the course, and\n    their violations will be reported to the SDSU administration.\n\nThis code of conduct is an adaptation of the [SciPy 2018 Code of\nConduct](https://scipy2018.scipy.org/ehome/299527/648147/index9a04.html).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Computer Applications\n\n## Computational Learning\n\n::: {.cell code-block-background='true' highlight-style='vim-dark' execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show me the code\"}\nimport libpysal.examples\nimport geopandas \n\n# get path to built-in dataset for Mexico\npth = libpysal.examples.get_path(\"mexicojoin.shp\")\n# load the file with geopandas to create a GeoDataframe\ngdf = geopandas.read_file(pth)\n# call the plot method of the GeoDataFrame\ngdf.plot(edgecolor='white');\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](01-example_files/figure-revealjs/cell-2-output-1.png){width=676 height=411}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Open Source\n\n\n![](images/pysal.png)\n\n\n## Server or Laptop\n\nYou can choose to either use an account on our course [JupyterHub]() or install the packages on your own laptop.\n\nEither way, you will be using Jupyter Notebooks for all computation:\n\n\n![](images/jupyter.png)\n\n\n\n# Introductions\n\n<!-- /Users/serge/Documents/p/pbpl273/20w/pp4gisprivate/content/lectures/lecture_01.md -->\n\n## My Program \n\n<CENTER>\n<img src=\"images/cgs.png\" alt=\"ac_hotel\" />\n</CENTER>\n\n[`url`](http://spatial.ucr.edu)\n\n## Why am I here\n<CENTER>\n<img src=\"images/john_sinton.png\" alt=\"ac_hotel\" />\n</CENTER>\n\n\n\n## Why am I here\n\n<CENTER>\n<img src=\"images/atlantic_city.png\" alt=\"ac_hotel\" />\n</CENTER>\n\n\n## ['Trump turned this place into a ghost town']( https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/apr/08/atlantic-city-trump-ghost-town-gambling-brian-rose-photographer)\n<CENTER>\n<img src=\"images/ac_hotel.png\" alt=\"ac_hotel\" />\n</CENTER>\n\n\n\n## Stockton\n<CENTER>\n<img src=\"images/ac_stockton.png\" alt=\"ac_hotel\" />\n</CENTER>\n\n## Stockton\n<CENTER>\n<img src=\"images/camp0.png\" alt=\"ac_hotel\" />\n</CENTER>\n\n\n\n## Stockton\n<CENTER>\n<img src=\"images/camp1.png\" alt=\"ac_hotel\" />\n</CENTER>\n\n\n## Stockton\n<CENTER>\n<img src=\"images/camp2.png\" alt=\"ac_hotel\" />\n</CENTER>\n\n\n## Stockton\n<CENTER>\n<img src=\"images/camp3.png\" alt=\"ac_hotel\" />\n</CENTER>\n\n\n\n\n## You\n\nTake a few minutes and let us know a bit about yourself\n\n- Name\n- Program/Concentration\n- Why you are here\n\n\n# Next Up\n</br>\n**Introduction to Spatial Analysis**\n\n\n<!-- # An Include Follows -->\n\n<!-- {{< include shared/open_source.qmd >}} -->\n\n",
